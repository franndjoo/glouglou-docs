GlouGlou is a powerful SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) that enables seamless integration of email fetching capabilities into your codebase without incurring any additional costs. Designed with efficiency and scalability in mind, GlouGlou's threading support ensures that your emails are delivered faster and reliably.

This SaaS is meant to be used on your production server and be targeted with email sending requests. If you don't want to bother with hosting your GlouGlou instances yourself, you can use our service provider (coming later this year).
