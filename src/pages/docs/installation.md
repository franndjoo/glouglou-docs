# Installation

<br>

To install GlouGlou, <a href="">download the executable from GitHub</a> (available for Windows and Linux). You'll just need to put it on the directory of your choice.

Choose the directory you'll use carefully as GlouGlou creates/needs a bunch of file it generates to work properly.
