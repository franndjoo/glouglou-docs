# API Keys
<br>

<h2 style="color: var(--accent);">How API keys are generated ?</h2>
<hr>
<br>

API keys are automatically generated by the GlouGlou instance, data about those keys are saved inside a file named `gg.skey`. You'll see, when starting the executable for the first time that the executable will have auto-generated an API key for the first time.

There is only one API key per GlouGlou instance, the ability to add more API keys will be available later.
